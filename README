CountrySelect
=============

Provides a simple helper to get an HTML select list of countries.  The list of countries comes from an ActiveRecord model.

Based on the original work of Michael Koziarski which used a constant for the country names.

Example
=======

country_select("user", "country_name")

The plugin defaults to using the "Country" model with field "Name". Override COUNTRY_SELECT_MODEL_NAME and COUNTRY_SELECT_MODEL_FIELD for different behavior.
